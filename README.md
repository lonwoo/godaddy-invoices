# godaddy-invoices

This originally came fro https://gist.github.com/c0ldlimit/4089101 but no longer worked anymore so I made some mods and decided to put it up on my own github page.

Use nightmare to login to GoDaddy, grab all invoice data and render to pretty PDFs

Edit `example.env`, save as `.env` then:

```
npm i
node godaddy.js
```
